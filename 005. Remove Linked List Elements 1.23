Features:
  1. remove linked list
  
Solution:
  1. Use a dummy node to record the start of the linked list. Also it helps to remove the first node if the first one is equal to the target value.
  2. When the current node is not the end of linked list, comparing the current value to the target value.
      If the value is the target value, changing the current node's next pointer and pointing to the next next node's data;
      If not, still points to the next node's data.
  3. return the dummy node's next pointer.
      
Notes:
  1. next points to the next linked list node
