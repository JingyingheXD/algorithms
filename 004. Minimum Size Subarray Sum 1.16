Features:
  1. array
  2. find a shortest array, and the sum is greater than or equal to S
  
Solution:
  1. Brute Force: go through the array and calculate the sum of sub-array one by one
    for (i ...):
      for (j ...)
  2. Slide Window: 
      1. use one for loop to go through the array. If we loop through start, it needs to use another for loop. It's same with the Brute Force method.
          So, we need to loop through end j.
      2. move the end one by one;
         move the start only if the current sum is greater than or equal to S (in order to find the nearest one)
      3. use a variable to save the shortest array length so far
